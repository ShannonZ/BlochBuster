# This configuration file is used as input to the Bloch simulator BlochBuster v1.2
# BlochBuster was written 2015 by Johan Berglund, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden
#
# The pulse sequence is defined by a comma separated list of triples (FA,T,spoil). Each triple represents:
# 1. An RF pulse of flip angle FA degrees
# 2. T msec dull time (relaxation will occur)
# 3. Optional spoiling of any transverse magnetization [true/false]
#
# The signal components (tissues) are defined by a comma separated list of component properties (name,Meq,shift,T1,T2):
# - name is the denomination that will be used in the figure legend (can be left blank)
# - Meq is the magnitude of the equilibrium magnetization
# - shift is the chemical shift [ppm]
# - T1 is the longitudinal relaxation time [msec]
# - T2 is the transversal relaxation time [msec]
